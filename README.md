## Description:
#### An application based on Instagram, with light and dark mode. Where you can create an account (register and log in) with validation, add photos from camera or gallery, search for users and follow them.

In this app, I studied the application of the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) design pattern in the project. In addition to different libraries to optimize application development.

I studied new methods of organizing layouts, such as how to apply a bottom navigation bar and how to navigate between fragments after the event of clicking on menus or buttons, how to create your own components in Android Studio, how to optimize code with ViewBinding or with Generics in fragments.

Also I studied the implementation of the Dependency Injection and the "Database in Memory" technique. And how to use the Firebase, such as the Back-end of the application, how to configure a remote server, perform user authentication, update the feed, posts, followers, etc...

#### Used Libraries:
* **CircleImageView** : *A fast circular ImageView perfect for profile images. This is based on RoundedImageView from Vince Mi which itself is based on techniques recommended by Romain Guy.*

* **AndroidImageCropper** : *Powerful (Zoom, Rotation, Multi-Source), customizable (Shape, Limits, Style), optimized (Async, Sampling, Matrix) and simple image cropping library for Android.*

* **Glide** : *Glide is a fast and efficient open source media management and image loading framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy to use interface.*

## Technologies used:
- Kotlin
- Android Studio
- Firebase
- Gradle
